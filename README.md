## TGE (Token Generation Event)

</div>

In May, there are plans for the creation of a new token (Currently, as of 20.05.2024, the HMSTR token has been released). This means that this month we can expect either a coin drop or its listing on exchanges. There has been no exact information from the developers yet, but it is clear that users can anticipate a major update. The possible token drop or listing will attract even more attention and new participants to the project, positively impacting its development and popularity.

## Token HMSTR

</div>

Scheduled for June, this indicates the developers' intention to create a second in-game token. After the main token mining is completed, users will be able to direct the earned coins to improve the exchange and increase the number of coins. These efforts will affect the mining of the new token. This innovation will add another level of depth and strategic planning to the gameplay, making it more engaging and profitable for users.

## Staking Information

</div>

There is unofficial information that users will be able to stake HMSTR in the Ethereum network (ERC-20). This new staking feature will allow users to earn rewards for locking up their ETH, providing another opportunity for participation and profit within the ecosystem. Moreover, the staking smart contract was launched without public access, giving early and savvy users a unique opportunity to take advantage of this feature ahead of others. All staked tokens can be transferred to the exchange and sold after the listing. Currently, the staking percentage is high, but it decreases daily as more people find this contract. This is one of the secret quests from the developers.

As of 22.05.2024, the reward rate for a deposit of 1 ETH is approximately 1 trillion tokens per day. The expected average price on exchanges is $40-80 per 1 trillion tokens.

The percentage depends on the amount of staked ETH.

### HOW TO STAKE HMSTR TOKEN?

To start staking, you need to create a staking contract:

1. Go to [EVM (RemixIDE)](https://remix.ethereum.org)
    
2. Create a new file `staking.sol`

4. Copy the source code of the contract and paste it into the created file. The source code of the contract can be found at [this link (staking.sol)](staking.sol).

5. Go to Solidity Compiler and click Compile staking.sol

15. By calling the **Withdraw function**, you transfer your ETH back to your wallet (only the contract creator can call this function).
